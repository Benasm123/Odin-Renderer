# Odin-Renderer

## Build
Install SDL2 and include the SDL2.dll file in the root of the project.
Run 
```
odin run .
```
Done.

However no meshes are included in the github repository, so will not run.
To add meshes add a Meshes folder and place meshes there.
Only supports Obj file format.

### 600 Meshes
